# Bills
Imagine you go out with your friends. You all eat, drink and have fun. But then, the bill arrives and you need to split it...  Our app offers a solution to this problem. Just take a photo of the bill using your mobile phone, and now everyone at the table will be able to easily calculate their bill (including tip).
